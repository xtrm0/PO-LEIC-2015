Hello,
Is there anybody in there?

Just nod if you can hear me.
Is there anyone at home?
4
5
Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
4
5
Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
4
5
Relax
I'll need some information first
4
5
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?
4

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
4
5
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
4
5
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
4
5
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
4
5
I have become comfortably numb
O.K.
4
5
Just a little pin prick
There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!
4
5
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
4
5
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
4
5
Come on, it's time to go.
There is no pain you are receding
4
5
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
4
5
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
4
5
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
4
5
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
4
5
The child is grown
The dream is gone
4
5
I have become comfortably numb.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
