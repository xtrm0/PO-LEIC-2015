0) Make changes:
	+ Reimplement section worker
	+ Identification factory should not exist
	+ Some stuff on the url is wrong
	+ Teacher doesnt likes the ideia of a recursive iterator. 
Maybe he didnt notice SectionOperator interface.
	+ Correct bugs with iterator (debug)

1) Make edt-core outside errors / bad arguments proof. (use exceptions)

2) Decide wheter or not use exceptions on edt-textui (ask teacher) -> we 
must use exceptions on core and threat them on edt-textui

3) Maybe test a litle bit?

4) Add comments

5) Reimplement Iterators to make code cleaner
